				<p className='text-lg mb-6'>
					At Bertemes Johnson & Company, we redefine the experience of working with a public accounting firm. Our
					commitment is simple: to provide full-service accounting, taxation, and consulting services with a personal
					touch. We are large enough to offer a comprehensive range of services, yet small enough to know you on a
					personal level.
				</p>

				<h3 className='sm:text-2xl text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-primary'>How We Charge For Our Services</h3>

				<p className='text-lg mb-6'>
					Say goodbye to the traditional invoicing model that leaves you cringing. Unlike other CPA firms, we offer
					small business clients a monthly fixed fee for accounting, payroll, and tax services. Your bill stays fixed,
					regardless of the hours spent on your account, resulting in potential savings exceeding 50% compared to
					traditional CPAs.
				</p>

				<p className='text-lg mb-6'>
					Our unique approach involves a preliminary assessment meeting to understand your small business needs.
					Bertemes Johnson & Company is committed to transparency and fairness in determining fees. Additionally, we
					extend fixed fees for annual services like corporate and individual tax preparation, ensuring predictability
					in your financial planning.
				</p>

				<h3 className='sm:text-2xl text-lg font-bold mb-4 text-primary'>Specialties</h3>

				<p className='text-lg mb-6'>
					Our dedication lies in serving individuals and owner-managed businesses. Every client receives personalized
					services tailored to their unique needs. Whether assisting in the selection of an operating entity,
					recommending accounting software, or designing an employee benefits package for a new business, we deliver
					results. Our credentials include being a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and QuickBooks® ProAdvisor. We have
					achieved the QuickBooks® Advanced Certified Advisor status, reflecting our commitment to excellence in
					service.
